1. Import necessary libraries: <bits/stdc++.h> for standard library inclusion.
2. Define a function validArrangement that takes a reference to a vector of vector of integers pairs representing pairs of integers and           returns a vector of vector of integers representing a valid arrangement of pairs.
3. Create an unordered map g to represent the graph, where keys are integers representing the first element of pairs and values are sets   containing the second elements of pairs connected to the key.
4. Create an unordered map deg to store the in-degree and out-degree of each integer in the graph.
5. Iterate through each pair in pairs:
    -Insert the second element of the pair into the set associated with the first element in g.
    -Increment the out-degree of the first element and the in-degree of the second element in deg.
6. Define a lambda function getsrc to find the source vertex of the Eulerian path:
    -Iterate through each pair of (element, degree) in deg.
    -If the difference between the out-degree and in-degree is 1, assign the element to src.
    -Return src.
7. Initialize a deque path to store the vertices of the Eulerian path.
8. Initialize a stack st to perform depth-first traversal.
9. Push the source vertex src onto the stack st.
10. While the stack is not empty:
   -Get the top element u from the stack.
   -If u has no outgoing edges:
     -Push u to the front of the deque path.
     -Pop u from the stack.
   -Otherwise:
     -Get the first element v from the set of outgoing edges of u.
     -Remove the edge (u, v) from the graph g.
     -Push v onto the stack st.
11. Create a vector of vector of integers ans to store the resulting arrangement.
12. Iterate from index 0 to index n - 2 of the deque path:
13. Push a vector containing the current element and the next element of path onto ans.
Return ans.
14. In the main function:
    -Read an integer n from the standard input.
    -Create a vector of vector of integers vp of size n.
    -Read n pairs of integers from the standard input and store them in vp.
    -Call the validArrangement function with vp and store the result in ans.
    -If the size of ans is not equal to n, print "No valid arrangement found !".
    -Otherwise, iterate through ans and print each pair of integers.
