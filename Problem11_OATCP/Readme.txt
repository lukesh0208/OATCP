1. Import the necessary library <bits/stdc++.h> for standard library inclusion.
2. Define a function count_subgrids that takes a 2D array color and its size n as input and calculates the number of subgrids with the same color.
3. Initialize a variable subgrids to keep track of the total number of subgrids.
4. Iterate through all pairs of rows a and b in the 2D array color.
5. Initialize a variable count to count the number of columns where both rows a and b have the same color.
6. Iterate through each column i of the rows a and b.
7. If the color in both rows a and b at column i is 1 (indicating the same color), increment the count.
8. Calculate the number of subgrids formed by rows a and b having the same color using the formula ((count - 1) * count) / 2 and add it to subgrids.
9. Return the total number of subgrids.
10. In the main function:
    -Read an integer n from the standard input, representing the size of the 2D array.
    -Dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array arr of size n x n.
    -Read n x n integers from the standard input and store them in the 2D array arr.
    -Call the count_subgrids function with the 2D array arr and size n, and store the result in variable res.
    -Output the value of res to the standard output.
