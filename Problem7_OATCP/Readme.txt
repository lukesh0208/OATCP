1. Input the number of elements n and the elements themselves.
2. Convert each element to a string and store them in a vector v.
3. Define a comparison function comp such that when two strings a and b are concatenated, the larger concatenated string comes first.
4. Sort the vector v using the comparison function comp.
5. If the largest concatenated string starts with '0', set the answer to "0".
6. Otherwise, concatenate all strings in the sorted vector v and set the answer to the resulting string.
7. Output the answer.
