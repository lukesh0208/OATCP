1.Import the necessary libraries (<bits/stdc++.h> for standard library inclusion).
2.Define a function hammingDistance that takes two integers x and y as input and calculates the Hamming distance between them.
3.Initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of differing bits.
4.Iterate through each bit position from 31 (most significant bit) to 0 (least significant bit).
5.Extract the corresponding bit from x and y using bitwise AND operation with (1 << i).
6.Compare the extracted bits, if they are different, increment the count.
7.Return the count as the Hamming distance.
8.In the main function:
  8.1 Read an integer n from the standard input.
  8.2 Initialize an integer m with the value of n.
  8.3 Declare a vector nums to store n integers.
  8.4 Read n integers from the standard input and store them in the nums vector.
  8.5 Initialize a variable res to accumulate the total Hamming distance.
  8.6 Iterate through all pairs of integers in the nums vector using two nested loops.
  8.7 For each pair, add the Hamming distance between them to res.
  8.8 Output the value of res to the standard output.
