1. Include necessary libraries: The code includes <iostream> for input/output operations and <vector> to use vectors.
2. Define a constant: MOD is defined as 10^9 + 7.
3. Define the main() function:
    -Disable synchronization between C and C++ standard streams and untie the cin and cout streams for faster I/O.
    -Declare a variable n to store the size of the grid.
    -Read the size of the grid from the input.
4. Initialize the DP table: Create a 2D vector dp of size (n+1) x (n+1) initialized with zeros. This vector will store the number of ways to reach each cell in the grid.
5. Set base case: dp[0][0] is set to 1, as there is only one way to reach the starting cell.
6. Dynamic Programming:
    -Iterate through each row of the grid:
      -Read a string s representing the obstacles in the current row.
      -Iterate through each column of the grid:
        -If the current cell is not an obstacle ('*'):
          -If the current row is greater than 0, add the number of ways to reach the current cell from the cell above it (dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j]).
          -If the current column is greater than 0, add the number of ways to reach the current cell from the cell to its left (dp[i][j] +=  dp[i][j - 1]).
          -Modulo the result with MOD.
       -If the current cell is an obstacle, set dp[i][j] = 0.
7. Output the result: Print the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (dp[n - 1][n - 1]), modulo MOD. If n is 0, print -1.
8. Return 0: to indicate successful execution.
