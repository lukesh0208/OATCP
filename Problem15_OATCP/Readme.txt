1. Import necessary libraries: <bits/stdc++.h> for standard library inclusion.
2. Define a function genSubsequences that generates all subsequences of a given string str.
   -It takes parameters: the original string str, the current subsequence current, the current index index, and the length of subsequences      to generate length.
   -Initialize an empty vector of strings result.
   -If length is 0, push current to result and return.
   -If index equals the length of the string str, return result.
   -Recursively generate subsequences including the current character (withCurrent) and excluding the current character (withoutCurrent).
   -Concatenate withCurrent and withoutCurrent to result.
    Return result.
3. In the main function:
   -Open an input file named "input.txt" and an output file named "out.txt".
   -Read an integer n from the standard input.
   -Initialize an empty set of strings st.
   -Initialize a vector of vectors of strings vs to store the subsequences for each input string.
   -Iterate n times:
     -Read a string s from the standard input.
     -Read a string s from the input file.
     -Write a newline to the output file.
     -Initialize an empty vector of strings ans.
     -Iterate from length 1 to 4:
        -Generate subsequences of length i for string s using the genSubsequences function and store them in ans.
     -Push ans into vs.
  -Iterate through each vector of strings ans in vs:
     -Iterate through each string in ans and print it to the standard output and write it to the output file.
  -Write two newlines to the output file.
  -Close both input and output files.
4. Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
